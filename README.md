Covid-19 Trends Analysis using Tableau

The COVID-19 data for Canada was analyzed for the period of January-March 2020.  
The dataset is a modified version of the datatset found at https://www.kaggle.com/davidbnn92/weather-data-for-covid19-data-analysis?select=training_data_with_weather_info_week_4.csv . 

Only the rows for Canada are considered. Some columns present in the dataset were Date, Confirmed Cases, Fatalities and Temperature. 
The aim was to determine which provinces were COVID hotspots along with the distribution of cases across the provinces.

Note: Grand Princess is not a Canadian province. It is a luxury ship which Canadian passengers who later tested positive for COVID. The coordinates given in the dataset place it near the coast of California.
